# Arkhe(n) Experimental Validation Mappings

This document maps speculative predictions from ANL models to current and near-future technology for experimental verification.

## 1. Quantized Inertia (QI) - McCulloch Effect

**Prediction:** Inertia of an object should deviate from Newtonian values at extremely low accelerations (below $10^{-10} \, m/s^2$).

**Experimental Target:**
- **MEMS Accelerometers:** Next-generation ultra-low-noise MEMS can detect micro-g deviations.
- **Orbital Anomalies:** Precise tracking of Arkhe-1 cubesat constellation. Look for non-Newtonian drifts in high-altitude orbits where drag is negligible.
- **Cavity Experiments:** Measuring thrust in asymmetrical electromagnetic cavities (related to the disputed EmDrive/Horizon drive).

## 2. Vacuum Modification & Casimir Forces

**Prediction:** Modified vacuum geometry (Casimir cavities) results in measurable energy density shifts and potential propulsive forces.

**Experimental Target:**
- **Nano-positioning:** Use Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to measure the lateral Casimir force between micro-structured plates.
- **Optomechanical Cavities:** Measure the frequency shift of a mechanical oscillator coupled to a Casimir-induced field.

## 3. Einstein-Cartan (Torsion)

**Prediction:** Spin density of matter couples to spacetime torsion, affecting the precession of spinning particles.

**Experimental Target:**
- **Spin Polarized Matter:** Measuring the gravitational interaction between highly polarized electron/neutron sources.
- **Atomic Interferometry:** Detecting phase shifts in atom interferometers induced by local torsion fields from rotating massive objects.

## 4. Alcubierre Warp Metric (Sub-light)

**Prediction:** High-intensity electromagnetic fields can induce local metric perturbations (tilting the light cone).

**Experimental Target:**
- **Interferometry:** Using a modified Michelson-Morley setup (White-Juday Warp Field Interferometer) to detect picometer-scale path length changes in regions of extremely high voltage/charge density.
